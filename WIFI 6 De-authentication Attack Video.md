### About
This is a de-authentication performed by a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB model), running the Kali Linux operating system, against a WIFI 6 router. Due to the built in security of WIFI 6, the attack was unsuccessful. We decided to keep typos and errors in our video to highlight common real world occurrences.
