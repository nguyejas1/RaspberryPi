### About
This is a de-authentication performed by a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB model), running the Kali Linux operating system, against a WIFI 5 router. Due to the lack of sufficient built in security of WIFI 5, the attack was successful. We decided to keep typos and errors in our video to highlight real world occurrences.
